COSINE: Layer-2 Protocol for Real-Time Trustless Credit Scoring and Fraud Mitigation
Overview
COSINE (COnsensus Secured Interchain Network Environment) is a dynamic Layer-2 protocol that implements real-time, trust-minimized credit scoring mechanisms across blockchain networks. The protocol provides efficient and transparent creditworthiness assessment while maintaining decentralization principles.
Key Features

Sequential Voting Mechanism: Incorporates reputation-weighted votes that allow users to influence credit scores in real-time based on historical voting behavior.
Self-Tuning Dynamic System: Uses Kalman filters to automatically adjust scaling factors based on network conditions.
Cosine Similarity for Trust Assessment: Employs cosine similarity in vector space, offering a more stable measure of trustworthiness compared to traditional numeric credit scores.
Advanced Fraud Detection: Implements randomized time windows and multi-hop association risk analysis to identify malicious actors.
Cross-Chain Wallet Linking: Enables credit assessments to reflect activity across multiple blockchains, improving interoperability and trust across the DeFi ecosystem.
Hybrid Outlier Filtering: Combines mean-based and median-based approaches with dynamic thresholds for robust consensus.

Project Status
This repository contains the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) implementation of the COSINE protocol. The project is currently in development and includes:

Smart contract implementation (Ethereum-based)
Core consensus mechanism
Credit scoring engine with Kalman filters
Fraud detection system
Basic wallet linking functionality

Technical Architecture
COSINE is built using:

Go (core protocol implementation)
Solidity (smart contracts)
Ethereum for cross-chain integration
IPFS for decentralized data storage

The validator nodes operate without containerization, running directly as processes to simplify deployment and testing.
Deployment
The project can be deployed on Ethereum testnets and local blockchain environments (e.g., Ganache).
Future Development
Upcoming features include:

Complete cross-chain integration for Bitcoin
Enhanced governance functionality
Full API implementation
Production validator node setup
Comprehensive testing and security audits
